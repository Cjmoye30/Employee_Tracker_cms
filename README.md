  ### Description:

  - This is a project build in the command line which accesses/displays/updates a database of users based on their departments, roles, and salaries. Through the command line, the user is able to view all departments, view all roles within those departments, view all employees (full details are the employee, their role, the department they belong to, and their manager), add departments, add roles, add employees, and update and employee role. All inquirer input is validated, and any data which already exists in the database will not be duplicated from user input. 
  - This program only runs in the command line so there is no live site and only a walkthrough video linked below.
